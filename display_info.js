    // 2
    `What is Ethnomusicology?
    - "study of music from the cultural and social aspects of the people who make it"
    - the author followed some debates by ethnomusicologists`,

    `"Authenticity"?
    - understanding of music involving historical performance practices
    - "Authenticity is knowing what you are, and acting in accordance with that knowledge" - Taruskin

    Authentic to: 
    - composer's intentions
    - performance practice of that era
    - how music and instruments sounded like during the composer's era
    - "personal authenticity" - faithful to the performer`,

    // 3
    `The Listeners
    - whether or not listeners are under peer pressure to like or dislike a certain type of music.

    A listener should reflect
    - whether they like the performance
    - whether the performance means anything to them`,

    // 4
    `
    - Musical meaning can be located in the listener
    - John Dewey says that a work of art is a product (the music) combined with a human being (the listener), in which the listener enjoys the experience.
    - Should performers serve the tastes of the audience?
    - Was discussed in a music journal in Europe, 1997`,

    // 5
    `
    - Listeners tend to want to be in the majority regarding whether or not they liked or disliked a concert.
    - Listeners categorize what they call a good or bad performance, but don't understand what is good or bad.
    - Good as in a "well informed performance" or "aesthetically pleasing performance"
    - Dislike or like the music, composer, genre instead of the performance?
    - Whether or not all listeners should react the same way to a concert
    - Listeners should say whether they like or dislike music, instead of good vs bad performance
    - #mus[0] vs. #mus[1]`,

    // 6
    `Performer's Goals
    - What performer wants to convey?
    - What the music would have sounded like during the composer's lifetime
    - What the composer wished for the listener to hear
    - May have to break historical performance practice to obtain what the composer desired.`,

    // 7
    `Conveying to the Listener
    - How listeners interpret music
    - Performers need to communicate the composers message in a manner that is understood by the listeners
    - (argument used by those in support of Western art music tradition)`,

    // 8
    `Listener's view on Authenticity
    - listeners are able to listen to music that matches their tastes
    - many listeners don't care as much about the historical accuracy, but rather just enjoy the sound of the instrument. #mus[2] vs. #mus[3]
    - listeners judge music comparing to whatever they hear the most.
    - a "aesthetically good" performances to the listener uses the practice the listener is most familiar with.
    - using the instruments that the listener likes to hear.
    - Increase in people liking early music instruments is because of the increased availability of performances on such instruments`,

    // 9
    `
    - performance practice always existed, to please the living composers as well as the listener.
    - Interpretation: performer's role, audience's role.
    - only electronic/computer music is free of interpretation`,

    // 10
    `Authenticity of performance venue
    - Affects how the listener is able to perceive the music
    - some music is designed to be listened to with ambient noise
    - the acoustics of the hall - size and material
    - balance of the performance

    Sound recordings, with mixing to recreate the ambience of the performance space, "the sound technician has become a main participant in the interpretation of early music" (Goldberg)`,

    // 11
    `Authority
    - The "authentic" way of playing would have authority on how music is to be played
    - competed through aesthetics of the listener
    - Tomilson believes that what the composer originally intended, and what the original audience heard is very different compared to what performers believe the composer's original meaning`,

    // 12
    `Aesthetics of authentic performances
    - May simply be a fresh view on music that the listeners want
    - Has nothing to do with whether or not it's authentic
    - No authenticity in fight on opinions of "aesthetics", only research has any hard facts.
    - Performer must understand what the listener's aesthetic preferences are, and to let their music reach them in a performance.`
